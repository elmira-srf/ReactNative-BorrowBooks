# ReactNative-BorrowBooks
Hi there,
In this project, users can see the List of books that are taken from an API. Each book can have one of the 3 statuses; 1-borrowed: which means the current user has already borrowed the book and would be able to return it by clicking on a button. 2-notAvailable: This means the book is borrowed by another user and is not available. 3-available: This means the book is not borrowed and the user can borrow it by clicking on a button. The changes in the status of the book will be saved in firebase.
Hope you enjoy it.
